# NeuroResilience-DRL 🛡️🧠

### Enhancing Network Resilience via Hybrid Deep Reinforcement Learning
This repository contains the implementation of a **Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)** agent designed to identify critical bottlenecks in complex networks. This project is part of a Master's Thesis focusing on hybridizing **Exact Cut Methods** with **PPO/DQN** agents.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Custom Gym Environment:** Simulating network interdiction problems.
- **Graph Theory Integration:** Using NetworkX for Max-Flow/Min-Cut calculations.
- **RL Agent:** Implementation of PPO using Stable-Baselines3.
- **Goal:** To overcome the scalability issues of exact methods on large graphs.

## 📊 Status
- [x] Phase 1: Prototype Environment & Pure RL Agent (Completed)
- [ ] Phase 2: Action Masking Implementation
- [ ] Phase 3: Hybridization with Exact Cuts (Gurobi/CPLEX)
- [ ] Phase 4: Final Evaluation & Paper Submission (arXiv)
